# HTML Learning Journey

This markdown file was originally created along commits for every 5 lessons in which I learnt HTML little by little.
However, I accidentally damaged the repository so this is a new repo, fresh start.

I am following the [HTML course on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAw_t_XWUFbBX-c9MafPk9ji&si=dUjI7GmryJQCPplX) to learn HTML.
I use GitHub Copilot to manage my code and assist with my task
